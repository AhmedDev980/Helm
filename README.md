In an application, because we cannot handle everything individually during installation, we will use helm to handle everything.

For example, if we wish to install a game, we cannot install the game's audio, visuals, game files, and so on individually. Instead, we'll simply install the game by specifying the URL to the download.

To know the error for helm we can clone that repo and specify branch which we want if needed and enter the command-----> helmversion filename  --debug./.



Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes, designed to simplify the deployment and management of applications in a Kubernetes cluster. It provides a way to define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes applications. Helm packages applications as "charts," which are collections of pre-configured Kubernetes resources.

Here's an overview of Helm and its key features:

1. What is a Helm Chart?
A Helm chart is a collection of Kubernetes resource files (such as Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, etc.) bundled together, and it comes with a configuration system. A chart allows you to define how an application should be deployed and configured in Kubernetes. You can think of it like a template or a blueprint for deploying applications on Kubernetes.

2. Key Concepts in Helm
Release: When you install a Helm chart, it creates a "release." A release is a specific instance of a chart running in a Kubernetes cluster. Each release has its own configuration and can be upgraded or rolled back independently.

Chart: A Helm chart contains all the Kubernetes manifests and templates needed to deploy an application (e.g., Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps). Charts can be versioned and shared with others.

Repository: Helm charts can be stored in chart repositories. These repositories are like package repositories where you can find Helm charts that others have created and shared.

3. Why Use Helm?
Helm simplifies Kubernetes application deployment in several ways:

Reusable Configurations: Charts allow you to define reusable and shareable configurations for applications.

Versioned Packages: Just like package managers (e.g., apt, npm), Helm allows you to version your Kubernetes application deployments. This makes it easy to upgrade, rollback, or manage your apps.

Template Engine: Helm charts are configurable, and you can template configurations using variables in the values.yaml file, allowing you to customize deployments based on different environments (development, production, etc.).

Dependency Management: Helm allows charts to have dependencies on other charts. For example, if your application depends on a database, you can include that database chart as a dependency and Helm will manage both deployments together.
