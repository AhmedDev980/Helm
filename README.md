In an application, because we cannot handle everything individually during installation, we will use helm to handle everything.

For example, if we wish to install a game, we cannot install the game's audio, visuals, game files, and so on individually. Instead, we'll simply install the game by specifying the URL to the download.

To know the error for helm we can clone that repo and specify branch which we want if needed and enter the command-----> helmversion <file name > ./.
